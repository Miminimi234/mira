            <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Mira ("we", "our", "us") collects, uses, discloses, and protects
                personal

                the
                Service you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

            <h2>1. Scope</h2>
            <p>This policy applies to personal information collected through our website, mobile apps, APIs, and other

                not
                control.</p>

            <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

                <li><strong>Content you submit:</strong> any content you upload or post through the Service (including

                    analytics.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
            <p>We use personal information for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To provide, operate, and maintain the Service.</li>
                <li>To create and manage your account, authenticate access, and provide customer support.</li>
                <li>To process payments and prevent fraud.</li>

                <li>To comply with legal obligations and enforce our terms and policies.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Lawful Basis for Processing (EEA/UK)</h2>
            <p>If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the UK, we rely on one or more of the following legal
                bases
                to process your personal data: your consent; performance of a contract; compliance with a legal
                obligation; our
                legitimate interests (for example, to operate and improve the Service, prevent fraud, and secure our
                systems).</p>

            <h2>5. Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
            <p>We do not sell personal data. We may share personal information with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> hosting providers, payment processors, analytics providers,

                    assets.</li>

                    property,

                <li><strong>With your consent:</strong> when you ask us to share information or we otherwise disclose it
                    with your
                    permission.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Third-Party Services and Integrations</h2>
            <p>We use third-party services to operate and improve the Service. These vendors may receive Personal
                Information
                as processors. Common categories include:</p>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>Payments:</strong> (e.g., Stripe, PayPal)</li>
                <li><strong>Analytics &amp; Crash Reporting:</strong> (e.g., Google Analytics, Sentry, Plausible)</li>
                <li><strong>Email &amp; Messaging:</strong> (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun, Twilio)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These third parties have their own privacy policies. We recommend reviewing them for details on how they
                handle
                your data.</p>

            <h2>7. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
            <p>We and our partners use cookies and similar technologies to provide, personalize, and protect the
                Service, and
                for analytics. You can manage cookie preferences through your browser settings or device settings. For
                details on
                specific cookies used, please contact us.</p>

            <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>We retain personal information as long as necessary to provide the Service, for legitimate business
                purposes,
                to comply with legal obligations, and to resolve disputes. When data is no longer required, we delete or
                anonymize it.</p>

            <h2>9. International Transfers</h2>
            <p>We may transfer personal information to countries outside your jurisdiction for the purposes described in
                this
                policy. When transferring personal data from the EEA/UK, we implement safeguards such as standard
                contractual
                clauses or rely on adequacy decisions where available.</p>

            <h2>10. Security</h2>
            <p>We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect personal
                information. No
                method of transmission or storage is 100% secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security. We maintain
                incident
                response practices and will notify affected users and authorities as required by law in the event of a
                data
                breach.</p>

            <h2>11. Your Rights</h2>
            <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights regarding your personal information, including:</p>

                <li>Withdraw consent: where processing is based on consent, you may withdraw it (this does not affect
                    processing already completed).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To exercise these rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@miramaps.io">privacy@miramaps.io</a>. We
                may need

                timeframes.</p>

            <h2>12. Children</h2>
            <p>Our Service is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or higher age where required). We do not

                to
                request information about the categories of personal information we have collected or sold, and the
                right to
                opt-out of the sale of your personal information. We do not sell personal information for monetary
                consideration.
                To exercise California privacy rights, contact <a
                    href="mailto:privacy@miramaps.io">privacy@miramaps.io</a> and

            <h2>14. International Users</h2>
            <p>By using the Service, you consent to the transfer of your information to the United States and other
                countries
                where our service providers operate. Those countries may have data protection laws different from your
                own.</p>

            <h2>15. Automated Decision-Making</h2>
            <p>We may use automated systems to process data for operational purposes (e.g., fraud detection,
                personalization).
                If you have questions about automated decisions that significantly affect you, contact us.</p>

            <h2>16. Links to Other Sites</h2>
            <p>The Service may contain links to third-party websites and services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to
