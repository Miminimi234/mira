                            <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>

                            <h2>10. Indemnification</h2>
                            <p>You agree to indemnify and hold Mira harmless from claims, liabilities, damages, losses,

                                responsible for the
                                practices or content of third parties. Use of third-party services is at your own risk
                                and subject to their
                                separate terms.</p>

                            <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
                            <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where Mira is incorporated,
                                without regard to
                                conflict-of-law principles. You agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
                                located in that jurisdiction
                                for disputes arising out of these Terms, subject to any mandatory consumer protection
                                laws that apply to you.</p>

                                notice through the
                                Service or by other means. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes
                                acceptance of the revised
                                Terms.</p>
